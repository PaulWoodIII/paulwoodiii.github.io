title: Cocoapods 0.36 update
---

Cocoapods are in all my projects I have a pod file I use to start all my projects just so I know what I've got to start. I've known about this update for a while becasuse a preversion of this release was out for a while. I'm not a proactive developer I guess, or I'm just to busy, and I just updated the gem today.

I did this with little worry. I recently started commiting my cocoapods folder because the versions would often cause conflicts as a cocoapod got updated but my project did not. Little things could really stack up. Now with the cocoapods folder committed I can roll back the changes much easier. The instructions were easy to do this.

{% highlight text %}
sudo gem update cocoapods
pods install
{% endhighlight %}

The only problem I had was with linking external strings, which actually had to do with updating XCode to 6.2. 

A lot can happen in an iOS project in a few days, espcially with Apple and 3rd party developers as your dependancies. But in total I think I've spent more time writing this post than it took to update my project with the XCode and cocoapods changes.
