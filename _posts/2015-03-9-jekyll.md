I should start with Jekyll since its what I'm using to create this post. I haven't used it on a live website before so its worth documenting what I've done with it. I've known that other developers use it for blogging. I didn't expect it to be simple. Actually to start It's very simple, to make it great obviously it will need a lot of time. I don't need any fancy styling, & I personally love the idea that all of my post are written in Markdown and just posted to the internet when I `git push` a file to my github account.

For my tutorial I went to http://jekyllrb.com which has lots of post about many subjects.

So to start Jekjll I went through the automatic page generator on my Github repo's webpage and followed the wizard, selecting a theme. I then `git cloned` the repo to my Mac. I switched to the `gh-pages` branch of the repo. 

In the terminal I've done `sudo gem install bundler`. Then `sudo gem install jekyll`. I created a Gemfile with the content below

{% highlight ruby %}
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'github-pages'
{% endhighlight %}

I created a folder called `_posts`  I created this file called `jekyll.md` which is being used to render this very post. I started with something called *Frontmatter* which is a halrious way of saying for *header*.

{% endhighlight %}

Then to view on my local machine

{% highlight PowerShell %}
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
{% endhighlight %}

The baseurl thing is to view it on my local machine but on github it will have a baseurl of `DevJournal` and I have `DevJournal` in my config.yml

Note: I didn't have xcode-tools installed yet so I also needed to install them with `xcode-select --install` to get my bundle to install. 

I had some problems when I got into theming the site. It brought me down quite a rabbit hole. I needed to install a few more gems all done via bundler though. The theme and the files required can all be found int he commit that pushed this file to Github. 

I learned that Jekyll requires you to put the date in the post you are writing. Personally I wish it didn't do that. Also I wish that Jekyll had a way to list pages instead of post, but thats just symantics and might actually be available, I just haven't found it yet.

I went with the [Exemplar](https://github.com/tybenz/exemplar) theme. I doubt I'll keep it long but the layout looked best from afar. The main problem with themes in Jekyll is how much of the original theme you need to hard code yourself to get things to work.

Highlighting with Jekyll is done with [pygments](http://pygments.org/) and the languages available are robust but none for markdown which seems kinds odd but perhaps its too recursive.
